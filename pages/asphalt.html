            text='These images were taken of cracks in roadways in a small town in Northwest Connecticut. 
            These patterns may appear when water seeps into asphalt and undergoes cycles of contraction and expansion with changing temperatures.
            Moreover, as they ramify further through the seasons, roadworkers may continually patch over them with fresh tar, so that these strange glyphs are ever evolving.
            Their resemblance of calligraphic brushstrokes classifies them as "asemic", a term denoting a system resembling writing but with no inherent meaning.
            The suggestion of meaning, minus the meaning itself, is a fascinating dissonance.
            Equally fascinating is the idea that a certain seasonal temperature gradient or asphalt composition may subtly identify the glyphs of one region or another, like dialects. 
            These works were displayed at the Soil Factory in Ithaca, NY, as part of the exhibit "Body / Scapes."
