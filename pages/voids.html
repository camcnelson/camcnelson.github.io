      text='The Dominant Void was a brief, warmup assignment for my senior fall studio with Turner Brooks. The object was to use about a dozen wooden furring strips, as our only materials, to demarcate a space that feels more tangible even than the solid boundary that defines it.
      As I find that our minds are always wanting to extend curves that we see around us, I chose to cut thin lathes from my initally rigid furring strips and then glue-laminate them in curves, which I connected with a kind of finger joint according to a few simple rules I laid out for myself:
      
      1. Any two joining strips had to connect at a right angle, and
      
      2. They had to have the same direction of curvature at the point of their meeting
      
      Shown here are some of the paper maquettes I used to explore possible designs for this sculpture.
