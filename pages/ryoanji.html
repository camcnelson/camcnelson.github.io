    <h3>Zen Isovists</h3>
    <p>The stone garden at <a style='text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: black;' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dan-ji' target='new' >Ryoanji</a>, a Zen Buddhist Temple in Kyoto,
    is famous for the particular arrangement of its five clusters of stones: one
    can never see all the stones in their entirety at once. Some part of the
    scene is always obscured, no matter how hard one looks.
    Regardless of whether the garden's creators intended this effect, it has fascinated me.
    I wondered how one could set about to design a garden in
    this way. To investigate, I created a program that randomly
    generated other stone arrangements and checked them to
    see if they satisfied this condition, producing valid examples by
    brute force. To make this process more interactive, I created another program
    for visualizing what are essentially inverse-isovists: regions
    color-coded by how many stones can be seen at one time if
    one stands within them. In the images shown here, the lightest regions are those from which all of the "stones" in the "garden" can be
    seen in their entirety. With each darker shade, one more stone
    is occluded. Notice how quickly they are hidden as we add two, three, then five stones.
    Feel free to <a style='text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: black;' href='https://editor.p5js.org/cameron.nelson/embed/oPlNLk9dU' target='new'>play with it yourself.</a></p>

    <p>And five. Note how quickly the distinct visibility regions have multiplied.</p>
